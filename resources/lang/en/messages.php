        Marbyt is a technical consultancy focused on the development of specific software for the research world. As researchers, we know the complex and repetitive lab work; and as computer scientists we know for sure that many of these tasks can be automated or simplified with an algorithm, saving large amounts of time and money to the researcher.<br><br>
        However, each research group is different, so we focus on working hand in hand, looking for common projects and analyzing the specific characteristics, always from a biological point of view and with a clear and objective goal.<br><br>
